User Journey:

The top part of the diagram shows the user journey from registration to bank connection.
Each step collects different pieces of user information.


Fraud Detection System:

The central component is the Fraud Detection System, which interacts with other parts of the system.
It's connected to a User Profile Database and a Machine Learning Model.


Data Collection and Storage:

As users progress through the journey, their data is stored and updated in the User Profile Database.
This allows for real-time updates and comparisons.


Initial Fraud Check:

After the bank connection step, an initial fraud check is performed.
This check queries the Fraud Detection System to look for potential matches.


Decision Points:

If no match is found, the user proceeds with the loan application.
If a potential match is detected, the application goes to manual review.


Manual Review:

Human intervention for borderline cases.
Can either approve the application to proceed or reject it.


Machine Learning Model:

Continuously trained on user data and fraud patterns.
Helps improve the accuracy of fraud detection over time.

Admin Interface:

Includes a dashboard for monitoring and an alert system.
Allows administrators to review flagged cases and overall system performance.



Key Features and Rationale:

Multi-point Verification: By collecting and verifying data at multiple stages, the system creates a more comprehensive user profile, making it harder for fraudsters to create multiple accounts.

Real-time Updates: The User Profile Database is updated at each step, allowing for immediate fraud checks and reducing the wait time for users.
Machine Learning Integration: This allows the system to adapt to new fraud patterns and improve accuracy over time, reducing false positives and negatives.

Balanced Approach: The system uses automatic checks for efficiency but includes manual review for borderline cases, balancing speed with accuracy.
Privacy and Security: The centralized User Profile Database ensures that sensitive information is stored in one secure location, rather than being distributed across multiple systems.

Flexibility: The system can easily incorporate additional data points or verification steps in the future if needed.

User Experience Consideration: By performing the main fraud check after all data is collected, the system minimizes interruptions in the user journey while still maintaining security.
